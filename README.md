# kidtodoapp
This is a kid friendly to do app I'm working on. I'm still learning, so this is good practice.

This is meant to be a simple to do app - a user clicks on an image in the column on the right, and 
a corresponding list item is made on the left. This is a work in progress and I plan to update as I learn
more about javascript.
